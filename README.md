# Progeny Recombinant: An adventure in gene manipulation
## GitHub Game Off 2016

## The Premise

You are an almost all-powerful being. You can change the very fabric of your experiments,
and yet you refuse to meddle in their puny societal practices. Your star trekian methodology
lands you in a tough spot, because you are on assignment to alter the future of organisms 
strewn across the galaxy. Nonetheless, you take on this challenge confident in your skills.

## The Gameplay

You find yourself coming across societies of organisms that have their own unique ways of 
grouping together and attacking one another. You must learn these social practices and use 
them, along with your ability to change the very nature of each organism, their shape, their
color, in order to achieve a certain state of the society.

What you can do:

* Introduce new organisms into the society tailored to your specifications
* Join organisms in the society and mangle their genes and change them wildly

What you can't do:

* Prevent organisms from mauling each other to bits and pieces. Be careful.

## How to Build / Play

This game is built in Unity, version 5.4.0. Any version greater than or equal to this should 
work fine. To build the project, create an empty project in Unity, copy the Assets and 
Project Settings folder into this project. Then go to File > Build & Run. Choose your platform
and then click Build, or Build and Run. 

In case this process is too frustrating, you can just download the built version I have on 
Git. 

## Enjoy!
